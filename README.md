# GNUsed cheat sheet

    Search:

    /hello/=              # puts cursor on the line where first occurrence of "hello" is found
    10,20 {/hello/=}      # same as above but within lines 10-20
    10,$ {/hello/=}       # same as above but from line 10 to the end of document


    Replace:

    s/hello/hi/g          # replace "hello" with "hi" in the entire document
    10 s/hello/hi/        # same but only on line 10
    10,20 s/^/    /       # set indentation 4 spaces within the lines 10-20
    s/ *$//g              # remove trailing spaces entire document

    Move:

    1,10d                 # delete lines 1-10
    1,10H; 11g            # copy lines 1-10 and paste to line 11
    1,10H; 11g 1,10d      # cut lines 1-10 and paste to line 11

    NOTE: to use GNUsed on Windows you need first to install it and make
          sure 'sed.exe' utility is available system wide, you can find
          the windows installer file in this repo in a folder 'sed'.

# Usage
    $ ego                 # opens editor with 'out.txt' source file name
    $ ego my_file.txt     # opens editor with 'my_file.txt' if it exists,
                          # otherwise sets source filename to 'my_file.txt'
