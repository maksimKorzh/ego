        EGO - A bare bones text editor written in Go
      ================================================

                           CONCEPT
                          ---------

  Think of the simplest text editor you've ever encountered.
  What comes to your mind? Windows Notepad right? But it is
  not as minimalist as possible because of the GUI. So what
  if we strip down the GUI and stick purely to the terminal
  environment dropping menus duplicating the most essential
  keyboard shortcuts and use a single command line argument
  to provide a file name? This would give us a text editing
  tool stripped down to the bare bones but yet practical to
  get work done the simplest and a most straightforward way.
